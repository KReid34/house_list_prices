# House List prices
If you are in the market for buying a house use this to organize your search. You can create your own google form and substitute it for GOOGLE_FORM = "YOUR FORM HERE". The form can have as many short-answer questions as you like, but this will change the amount of drive points you will need to create. I used three: Address of the house, price of the house, and link to the property webpage. This is currently set up for houses in Dunfermline, Scotland.
This is my version of the webscraping capstone project from theAppBrewery's Python Bootcamp.


Libraries used:
  Selenium
  Butiful Soup
  Time
  
  Note:
   You will need to create your own of the following variables:
   
   
    CHROME_DRIVER_PATH = "" 
        # This will be wherever you have your chrome driver installed # 
        
     GOOGLE_FORM = "YOUR GOOGLE FORM LINK"
        # Make this in your google drive. You can convert it to a google sheet after youve collected the data! #
        
     my_espc_dunfermline = "URL OF ESPC SEARCHING YOUR DESIRED AREA"
        # Change the area to a location near you and then change the variable to reflect that #
        
 I hope you enjoy my version of this project!
